# Casino

This repo contains the assets for our flagship Vegas City casino, which will initially house our Decentral Games slots machines playable with MANA. The casino is built in an Art Deco theme and contains three portions: a stratosphere and walkway, a casino building, and a nightclub building.

To run this scene, create a new project folder and run: 

```
dcl init
```

Then, download this repo and move all its folders into the new project folder and run: 

```
dcl start
```
